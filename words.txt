cycling
was
then
an
uncommon
sport
in

the

now

the
growth

in

caused
a
lack

in

which
became

downmarket
and
considered
by
some
a
vulgar
form
of
transport
by
the

era
of
the

stopped
there
at

the

car
would
represent
the

was
necessary

the

ratified

years

advances
in

represented
by

forced
the

to
reevaluate

it
considered

but
the

rejected

plan
and
authorized
only
the
dreadnought
nagato
and
two
battlecruisers
in
the
budget
later
that
year
american
president
woodrow
wilson
announced
plans
for
ten
additional
battleships
and
six
battlecruisers
and
the

authorized
three
more

the
following
year
a
second
nagato
class
battleship
mutsu
and
two
to
a
modified
design
tosa
and
kaga
the
ijn
began
reevaluating
the
nagato
design
in
light
of
lessons
learned
from
the
battle
of
jutland
in
may
experiments
evaluating
armor
protection
and
newly
acquired
information
on
the
protective
schemes
of
british
and
american
capital
ships
these
lessons
highlighted
the
need
for
better
protection
of
the
main
gun
turrets
and
magazines
as
well
as
thicker
deck
armor
to
protect
against
plunging
fire
existing
methods
of
defense
against
mines
and
torpedoes
had
also
proved
to
be
inadequate
and
needed
improvement
eleven
new
designs
were
rejected
between
october
and
early
before
captain
yuzuru
hiraga
superintendent
of
shipbuilding
and
the
naval
architect
in
charge
of
the
fundamental
design
of
the
ships
of
the
eight
eight
fleet
presented
a
heavily
modified
version
of
the
nagato
design
a
to
be
built
in
lieu
of
the
second
ship
of
the
class
mutsu
on
june
well
before
she
was
actually
laid
down
hiraga
s
design
for
the
ship
reflected
the
latest
combat
experience
as
well
as
incorporating
advances
in
boiler
technology
it
added
an
extra
twin
main
gun
turret
using
space
and
weight
made
available
by
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
boilers
from
to
while
the
power
remained
the
same
he
reduced
the
secondary
armament
from
guns
to
they
were
moved
up
a
deck
to
improve
their
arcs
of
fire
and
their
ability
to
shoot
during
heavy
weather
to
increase
the
ship
s
protection
he
proposed
to
angle
the
belt
armor
outwards
to
improve
its
resistance
to
horizontal
fire
and
to
thicken
the
lower
deck
armor
and
the
torpedo
bulkhead
hiraga
also
planned
to
add
anti
torpedo
bulges
to
improve
the
ship
s
underwater
protection
he
estimated
that
his
ship
would
displace
as
much
as
nagato
although
it
would
cost
about
a
million
yen
more
these
changes
would
have
considerably
delayed
the
ship
s
completion
and
were
rejected
by
the
navy
ministry
the
rejected
design
formed
the
basis
for
a
much
larger
metric
ton
long
ton
battleship
designated
as
a
with
nearly
twice
as
much
armor
weight
as
the
nagatos
it
was
designed
to
achieve
the
same
speed
as
the
older
ships
to
allow
them
to
maneuver
together
as
a
tactical
formation
this
design
was
accepted
on
march
and
became
the
tosa
class
the
tosa
class
ships
had
a
planned
displacement
of
t
long
tons
and

at
a
full

they
would
have
been

long
at

waterline
and

overall
the
ships
would
have
had
a
beam
of
meters
ft
and
a
draft
of

the
tosa
class
would
have
had
a
metacentric
height
of
meters
ft
in
at

load
a
turbo
electric
propulsion
system
was
considered
for
these
ships
after
the
united
states
announced
that
the
system
was
a
great
success
in
the
battleship
uss
new
mexico
and
the
japanese
estimated
that
a
shaft
horsepower
kw
turbo
electric
plant
could
be
installed
in
the

class
which
would
have
given
the

vallenato
along

is
a
popular
folk
music
of

it
primarily
comes
from

vallenato
literally
means

colombia
s
traditional
vallenato
music
is
intangible
cultural
heritage
in
need
of
urgent
safeguarding
according
to
unesco
this
form
of
music
originated
from
farmers
who
keeping
a
tradition
of
spanish
minstrels
juglares
in
spanish
mixed
also
with
the
west
african
inherited
tradition
of
griots
african
version
of
juglar
who
used
to
travel
through
the
region
with
their
cattle
in
search
of
pastures
or
to
sell
them
in
cattle
fairs
because
they
traveled
from
town
to
town
and
the
region
lacked
rapid
communications
these
farmers
served
as
bearers
of
news
for
families
living
in
other
towns
or
villages
their
only
form
of
entertainment
during
these
trips
was
singing
and
playing
guitars
or
indigenous
gaita
flutes
known
as
kuisis
in
the
kogi
language
and
their
form
of
transmitting
their
news
was
by
singing
their
messages
the
first
form
of
vallenato
was
played
with
gaita
flutes
guacharaca
and
caja
and
later
adopted
other
instruments
like
guitars
these
troubadors
were
later
influenced
by
europe
s
instruments
piano
and
accordion
shocked
with
the
sound
from
the
accordion
troubadors
probably
obtained
later
on
accordions
from
aruba
and
curaçao
vallenato
was
considered
music
of
the
lower
class
and
farmers
but
gradually
started
penetrating
through
every
social
group
during
the
mid
th
century
don
clemente
quintero
a
prominent
member
from
the
region
s
elite
was
a
lover
of
this
music
usually
accompanied
by
liquor
was
a
form
of
entertainment
for
this
almost
isolated
region
he
then
decided
to
start
a
parranda
party
inside
the
very
strict
valledupar
social
club
with
friends
this
triggered
an
acceptance
for
the
music
and
it
became
a
regular
feature
at
parties
carnivals
and
reunions
not
for
dancing

for

the
traditional
vallenato
developed
into
a
more
orchestra
type
of
musical
group
throughout

some
groups
started
adding

known

some

robin
hood
and
the
butcher
is
a
story
in
the
robin
hood
canon
which
has
survived
as
among
other
forms
a
late
seventeenth
century
english
broadside
ballad
and
is
one
of
several
ballads
about
the
medieval
folk
hero
that
form
part
of
the
child
ballad
collection
which
is
one
of
the
most
comprehensive
collections
of
traditional
english
ballads
it
may
have
been
derived
from
the
similar
robin
hood
and
the
potter
robin
hood
meets
with
a
jolly
butcher
on
horseback
on
his
way
to
sell
his
meat
at
a
fair
robin
appreciates
the
butcher
s
good
nature
and
asks
him
about
his
trade
and
where
he
lives
the
butcher
refuses
to
say
where
he
lives
but
tells
robin
he
is
going
to
a
fair
in
nottingham
and
in
response
robin
queries
him
about
the
price
of
his
meat
and
horse
interested
in
becoming
a
butcher
himself
although
in
some
variants
he
fights
with
the
butcher
in
all
variants
robin
buys
the
butcher
s
goods
and
goes
into
nottingham
where
he
sells
a
lot
of
meat
at
ridiculously
low
prices
the
other
butchers
suspect
that
he
is
a
prodigal
who
is
wasting
his
inheritance
for
he
sold
more
meat
for
one
penny
than
others
could
do
for
five
which
made
the
butchers
of
nottingham
to
study
as
they
did
stand
saying
surely
he
was
some
prodigal
that
had
sold
his
fathers
land
they
invite
him
to
the
sheriff
s
where
their
guild
is
feasting
and
robin
and
the
butchers
make
merry
over
food
and
wine
since
robin
proposes
to
pay
for
all
their
food
and
drink
for
the
shot
i
will
pay
e
re
i
go
my
way
robin
says
the
butchers
and
the
sheriff
again
speculate
that
he
must
have
inherited
and
sold
some
land
for
a
lot
of
money
the
sheriff
asks
if
he
has
more
animals
to
sell
robin
says
he
has
two
or
three
hundred
beasts
on
one
hundred
acres
of
land
and
invites
the
sheriff
to
see
them
whereupon
the
sheriff
with
three
hundred
pounds
of
gold
on
his
person
rides
with
him
to
sherwood
forrest
not
knowing
robin
s
true
identity
the
sheriff
ironically
hopes
that
they
do
not
meet
a
certain
man
they
call
rob
hood
once
there
a
hundred
deer
happen
to
appear
and
robin
shows
them
to
the
sheriff
claiming
them
as
his
animals
but
the
sheriff
has
decided
he
does
not
like
robin
s
company
robin
then
summons
little
john
and
the
rest
of
his
men
with
his
horn
robin
takes
the
sheriff
s
portmanteau
and
counts
five
hundred
gold
pounds
in
it
which
he
intends
to
keep
for
himself
and
the
band
he
then
sends
the
sheriff
on
his
way
home
jokingly
commending
himself
to
the
sheriff
s
wife
before
riding
away
laughing
this
ballad
is
an
abridgment
of
an
older
ballad
robin
hood
and
the
potter
there
are
two
extant
versions
of
robin
hood
and
the
butcher
version
a
and
version
b
version
b
which
is
the
version
summarized
above
does
not
include
a
fight
between
robin
hood
and
the
butcher
which
takes
place
in
a
missing
part
of
version
a
and
in
robin
hood
and
the
potter
in
the
version
summarized
above
however
robin
does
mention
a
shot
during
the
feast
of
the
guild
which
probably
refers
to
an
archery
contest
between
robin
and
the
sheriff
s
men
in
which
robin
was
victorious
and
which
is
recorded
in
robin
hood
and
the
potter
version
a
was
discovered
in
the
percy
folio
the
most
important
source
for
the
child
ballads
collection
but
was
missing
three
half
page
sections
which
is
not
surprising
given
the
way
percy
and
previous
owners
of
the
folio
treated
it
there
are
several
differences
in
the
gross
features
and
nuance
of
plot
between
the
two
versions
in
version
a
robin
announces
that
the
sheriff
has
a
vendetta
against
him
thus
setting
the
stage
for
robin
s
later
encounter
with
the
sheriff
and
the
butcher
he
initially
meets
has
a
vicious
dog
that
flies
at
robin
s
face
and
is
then
killed
robin
also
strikes
at
the
butcher
presumably
according
to
the
potter
and
other
butcher
ballads
engaging
in
a
losing
fight
with
him
robin
then
buys
the
butcher
s
meat
and
travels
to
nottingham
disguised
as
a
butcher
where
he
attracts
the
attention
of
the
sheriff
s
wife
she
offers
him
and
any
of
his
company
shelter
and
robin
orders
drink
before
going
to
the
market
as
in
version
b
he
sells
the
meat
quickly
and
at
a
low
price
impressed
the
other
butchers
invite
him
to
come
drink
with
them
as
a
fellow
in
their
craft
the
account
of
robin
s
feast
with
them
is
missing
up
to
the
sheriff
s
offer
of
money
for
robin
s
beasts
which
robin
silently
plans
to
steal
when
they
are
in
sherwood
forest
when
the
sheriff
his
body
guard
butchers
and
robin
arrive
in
the
forest
again
robin
is
fortunate
to
see
many
deer
which
he
can
claim
as
his
own
but
the
sheriff
is
already
suspicious
robin
summons
his
band
with
his
horn
and
instead
of
little
john
and
a
few
others
fifty
archers
come
to
join
them
the
denouement
of
the
gathering
is
missing
from
this
version
but
in
the
next
stanza
the
sheriff
has
safely
arrived
home
in
nottingham
and
is
telling
his
wife
what
happened
as
in
the
other
version
robin
has
stolen
all
the
sheriff
s
money
and
has
complimented
him
on
his
wife
unbeknownst
of
whom
robin
would
have
beheaded
him
but
in
this
version
the
reason
for
the
compliment
is
clear
the
sheriff
praises
his
wife
for
her
kindness
to
robin
and
robin
for
teaching
him
a
lesson
and
vows
never
to
set
after
him
again
this
ballad
is
part
of
a
group
of
ballads
about
robin
hood
that
in
turn
like
many
of
the
popular
ballads
collected
by
francis
james
child
were
in
their
time
considered
a
threat
to
the
protestant
religion
puritan
writers
like
edward
dering
writing
in
considered
such
tales
childish
follye
and
witless
devices
writing
of
the
robin
hood
ballads
after
a
gest
of
robyn
hode
their
victorian
collector
francis
child
claimed
that
variations
on
the
robin
met
with
his
match
theme
such
as
this
ballad
are
sometimes
wearisome
sometimes
sickening
and
that
a
considerable
part
of
the
robin
hood
poetry
looks
like
char
work
done
for
the
petty
press
and
should
be
judged
as
such
child
had
also
called
the
roxburghe
and
pepys
collections
in
which
some
of
these
ballads
are
included
veritable
dung
hills
in
which
only
after
a
great
deal
of
sickening
grubbing
one
finds
a
very
moderate
jewel
however
as
folklorist
and
ethnomusicologist
mary
ellen
brown
has
pointed
out
child
s
denigration
of
the
later
robin
hood
ballads
is
evidence
of
an
ideological
view
he
shared
with
many
other
scholars
of
his
time
who
wanted
to
exclude
cheap
printed
ballads
such
as
these
from
their
pedigree
of
the
oral
tradition
and
early
literature
child
and
others
were
reluctant
to
include
such
broadsides
in
their
collections
because
they
thought
they
regularized
the
text
rather
than
reflecting
and
or
participating
in
tradition
which
fostered
multiformity
on
the
other
hand
the
broadsides
are
significant
in
themselves
as
showing
as
english
jurist
and
legal
scholar
john
selden
puts
it
how
the
wind
sits
as
take
a
straw
and
throw
it
up
in
the
air
you
shall
see
by
that
which
way
the
wind
is
which
you
shall
not
do
by
casting
up
a
stone
more
solid
things
do
not
show
the
complexion
of
the
times
so
well
as
ballads
and
libels
even
though
the
broadsides
are
cultural
ephemera
unlike
weightier
tomes
they
are
important
because
they
are
markers
of
contemporary
current
events
and
popular
trends
it
has
been
speculated
that
in
his
time
robin
hood
represented
a
figure
of
peasant
revolt
but
the
english
medieval
historian
j
c
holt
has
argued
that
the
tales
developed
among
the
gentry
that
he
is
a
yeoman
rather
than
a
peasant
and
that
the
tales
do
not
mention
peasants
complaints
such
as
oppressive
taxes
moreover
he
does
not
seem
to
rebel
against
societal
standards
but
to
uphold
them
by
being
munificent
devout
and
affable
other
scholars
have
seen
the
literature
around
robin
hood
as
reflecting
the
interests
of
the
common
people
against
feudalism
the
latter
interpretation
supports
selden
s
view
that
popular
ballads
provide
a
valuable
window
onto
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
the
common
people
on
topical
matters
for
the
peasantry
robin
hood
may
have
been
a
redemptive
figure

english
broadside
ballad
archive
at
the
university
of

university
of
cambridge
and
another
in
the
roxburghe

this
tale
has
reappeared
in
many
books
about
the
robin
hood
legend
including
howard
pyle
s
merry
adventures
of
robin
hood
although
the
threat
to
kill
the
sheriff
at
the
end
was
often
omitted
the
so
called
butcher
ballads
in
the
robin

ballad

stories

news
said
zombie

like
its

is
your
higher
quality
zombie
film
the
gore
is
top
notch
there
are
quite
a
few
scenes
with
true
scares
and
of
course
it
s
a
nice
homage
to
the
original
dead
trilogy
with
an
adherence
to
romero
s
rules
of
zombie
timeout
magazine
gave
the
film
three
stars
out
of
five
stating
that
compared
to
the
first
film
the
production
values
in
general
are
classier
and
co
directors
michael
bartlett
and
kevin
gates
s
handling
of
the
relentlessly
grim
apocalyptic
setting
is
more
assured
the
daily
star
awarded
the
film
seven
out
of
ten
stating
fans
of
fear
will
be
suitably
thrilled
and
chilled
by
the
survivors
bloody
and
grisly
trek
towards
safety
with
horrifying
run
ins
with
heartless
human
bandits
who
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
turn
out
to
be
almost
as
nasty
as
zombies
it
has
also
received
negative
reviews
receiving
one
star
out
of
a
possible
five
from
the
independent
and
with
gorepress
stating
world
of
the
dead
the
zombie
diaries
also
fails
to
improve
on
the
mistakes
of
its
predecessor
the
acting
is
still
shocking
in
places
the
make
up
insufficient
the
scares
almost
non
existent
the
plot
emaciated
and
the
dvd
cover
and
title
are
once
again
horribly
misleading
the
dvd
artwork
features
a
giant
ruined
cityscape
and
the
words
world
of
the
dead
smacked
over
it
but
we
never
see
anywhere
but
bedfordshire
and
the
biggest
building
we
witness
is
an
old
barn
which
isn
t
even
ruined
the
guardian
described
it
as
even
less
necessary
than
another
prison
drama
while
flickeringmyth
com
says
the
zombies
themselves
felt
very
non
threatening
it
almost
felt
like
they
just
organised
a
flash
mob
with
blank
firing
weapons
and
left
it
at
that
and
there
are
a
couple
of
frankly
unneeded
rape
scenes
one
on
a
female
zombie
that
just
felt
like
bartlett
and
gates
wanted
to
do
some
kind
of
rape
revenge
film
but
gave
up
and
worked
zombies
into
it
before
concluding
that
world
of
the
dead
zombie
diaries
just
feels
like
a
massive
waste
of
time
the
daily
mail
said
kevin
gates
moronic
dialogue
liberally
scattered
with
four
letter
words
is
as
devoid
of
ideas
as
his
direction
which
is
shared
with
someone
called
michael
bartlett
though
most
of
the
camerawork
suffers
from
st
vitus
s
dance
the
nastiest
of
several
torture
rape
murders
is
shot
needless
to
say
in
static
lovingly
lascivious
detail
and
described
the
film
as
an
minute
waste
of
electricity
the
phrase
not
even
wrong
describes
any
argument
that
purports
to
be
scientific
but
fails
at
some
fundamental
level
usually
in
that
it
contains
a
terminal
logical
fallacy
or
it
cannot
be
falsified
by
experiment
i
e
tested
with
the
possibility
of
being
rejected
or
cannot
be
used
to
make
predictions
about
the
natural
world
the
phrase
is
generally
attributed
to
theoretical
physicist
wolfgang
pauli
who
was
known
for
his
colorful
objections
to
incorrect
or
sloppy
thinking
rudolf
peierls
documents
an
instance
in
which
a
friend
showed
pauli
the
paper
of
a
young
physicist
which
he
suspected
was
not
of
great
value
but
on
which
he
wanted
pauli
s
views
pauli
remarked
sadly
it
is
not
even
wrong
this
is
also
often
quoted
as
that
is
not
only
not
right
it
is
not

in

native
german
peierls
remarks
that
quite
a
few
apocryphal
stories
of
this
kind
have
been
circulated
and
mentions
that
he
listed
only
the
ones
personally
vouched
by
him
he
also
quotes
another
example
when
pauli
replied
to
lev
landau
what
you
said
was
so
confused
that
one
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
nonsense

born
in
madison
county
iowa
was
in
california
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century
when
interest
was
being
awakened
in
the
possibilities
of
drilling
for
oil
in
e
j
emmor
jerome
miley
sold
his
fruit
holdings
and
joined
with
dabney
in
leasing
a
tract
in
the
mckittrick
district
in
the
san
joaquin
valley
ten
oil
wells
were
drilled
the
first
year
in

the
dabney

company
was
incorporated
with
capitalization
of

at

dabney
and
ralph
b
lloyd
formed
the
hildalgo
oil
company
to
drill
for
oil
in
simi
valley
california
near
the
ranch
owned
by
the
ventura
land
amp
water
company
the
family
firm
of

lloyd
and
his
children
at
the
time
ralph
b
lloyd
one
of
the
children
was
operating
the
ranch
and
persuaded
dabney
and
miley
to
drill
four
wells
in
the
area
all
of
them
were
dry
or
failed
to
sustain
production
miley
and
dabney
sold
their
interest
in
hildago
a
year
later
for
his
part
miley
would
continue
to
drill
wells
for
dabney
and
lloyd
as
state
consolidated
oil
company
state
consolidated
formed
by
miley
and
others
in
march
and
capitalized
at
million
did
rather
well
in
kern
county
california
and
by
was
operating
producing
wells
there
dabney
would
become
one
of
the
most
prominent
small
operators
of
the
los
angeles
basin
with
the
discovery
of
oil
at
signal
hill
california
between
his
dabney
oil
corporation
and
his
joseph
b
dabney
and
company
partnership
he
was
operating
producing
wells
by
despite
their
lack
of
success
in
the
simi
valley
ralph
lloyd
convinced
dabney
to
lease
much
of
the
ranch
lands
that
lay
on
either
side
of
the
ventura
river
and
adjacent
to
the
city
of
ventura
california
lloyd
had
attended
the
university
of
california
where
his
study
of
geology
confirmed
his
belief
that
his
family
s
ranch
and
those
around
it
lay
atop
a
vast
oil
pool
when
lewis
lloyd
sold
his
acres
km
of
pasture
that
straddled
the
ventura
river
in
lloyd
convinced
his
father
to
retain
the
mineral
rights
it
proved
to
be
a
wise
decision
state
consolidated
drilled
three
wells
on
this
property
and
another
on
the
adjacent
louis
hartman
ranch
but
miley
s
drilling
crews
were
unable
to
cope
with
the
enormous
gas
pressures
that
they
encountered
indeed
one
well
blew
out
dabney
and
lloyd
decided
to
bring
in
a
major
company
with
the
financial
resources
and
technology
to
handle
the
area
s
difficult
geology
and
steep
terrain
on
june
they
signed
an
agreement
with
shell
company
of
california
a
subsidiary
of
royal
dutch
shell
covering
more
than
acres
lloyd
and
four
other
landowners
in
the
area
to
received
the
industry
standard
royalty
on
leases
dabney
and
lloyd
received
an
overriding
royalty
on
each
lease
covered
by
the
agreement
lloyd
thought
he
had
an
exclusive
right
to
negotiate
leases
for
shell
shell
thought
otherwise
when
they
went
directly
to
southern
california
edison
to
negotiate
a
lease
lloyd
felt
betrayed
subsequently
lloyd
and
dabney
turned
to
the
associated
oil
company
another
california
major
offering
an
option
in
their
as
yet
unproven
part
of
the
ventura
field
in
february
they
and
state
consolidated
gave
an
option
on
acres
km
to
associated
oil
for
associated
gave
them
an
additional
for
materials
and
labor
incurred
in
redrilling
lloyd
no
during
the
option
period
when
associated
took
up
the
option
they
paid
another
for
a
lease
that
provided
a
royalty
and
one
third
of
the
oil
produced
plus
an
additional
that
started
after
associated
had
recovered
the
it
had
paid
for
option
and
lease
and
ended
after
the
gave
dabney
lloyd
and
state
consolidated
after
that
associated
only
paid
a
royalty
the
lloyd
lease
proved
to
be
one
of
the
most
lucrative
in
the
field
the
lease
also
required
that
associated
drill
so
called
offset
wells
to
prevent
draining
from
adjacent
leases
this
was
part
of
the
strategy
of
dabney
and
lloyd
to
develop
the
field
in
an
orderly
manner
indeed
both
associated
and
shell
cooperated
in
maximizing
the
long
term
output
of
the
field
which
to
date
has
produced
almost
one
billion
barrels
of
crude
oil
the
breakthrough
in
production
came
in
january
with
the
completion
of
associated
s

no
a

from
production
over
the
next

purpose
of
exploring
the
tecolote

miley

searched
for

in
this
area
as
well
indeed

miley

company
discovered
the
minor
goleta
field
in
february
rapid
encroachment
of

forced
miley
and

operators
to

eighteen
months
later
both
dabney

were
shut
out
of

xlat
rfc

software
into

the

or
an
intermediate

but
if
it

xlat
would
not
be

and
the

the

him
in
in
the
collection
of
the

moderne
de

his
style
in

landscapes
is
similar

lived
until
under
the
vichy
government
certain
critics
suggested
too
many
foreigners
especially
jews
were
diminishing
french
traditions
their
comments
were
part
of
a
rise
in
anti

during
the
german

in
the
deportation

of
tens

melbourne
for

controversy
arose
when
the

was
to
be
exhibited
on

the
presbyterian
assembly
found
the
painting
to
be
too
scandalous
to

so
it
had
to
eventually
be
taken

promising

went
as

fell
against

art
experts
said
the
damage
was
minor
and
would
not

the

was
repaired
at
the

for
this

was
named
marie
not
chloé
she
was
born
to
a
poor
family
in

was
of
persian
descent
she
left
home
at
a
young
age
and
started
posing
for
artists
in
order
to
gain
some
income
for
herself
and
her
sister
she
was
when
lefebvre
painted
her
for
chloé
considerable
controversy
surrounds
her
relationship
with
lefebvre
which
much
disagreement
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
relationship
some
have
said
that
she
had
a
sexual
relationship
with
him
while
others
have
said
that
he
rejected
her
another
account
says
that
he
seduced
both
marie
and
her
sister
whatever
the
truth
was
a
year
after
lefebvre
completed
the
chloé
painting
he
married
her
sister
a
year
after
that
marie
hosted
a
party
with
close
friends
during
which
she
slipped
away
into
the
kitchen
and
made
and
drank
a
poisonous
substance
the
exact
reason
for
her
suicide
remains
unknown
but
some
have
speculated
that
she
did
it
because
of
her
unrequited
love
for

low
complexity
art
first
described
by
jürgen
schmidhuber
in
and
now
established
as
a
seminal
topic
within
the
larger
field
of
computer
science
is
art
that
can
be
described
by
a
short
computer
program
that
is
a
computer
program
of
small
kolmogorov
complexity
schmidhuber
characterizes
low
complexity
art
as
the
computer
age
equivalent
of
minimal
art
he
also
describes
an
algorithmic
theory
of
beauty
and
aesthetics
based
on
the
principles
of
algorithmic
information
theory
and
minimum
description
length
it
explicitly
addresses
the
subjectivity
of
the
observer
and
postulates
that
among
several
input
data
classified
as
comparable
by
a
given
subjective
observer
the
most
pleasing
one
has
the
shortest
description
given
the
observer
s
previous
knowledge
and
his
or
her
particular
method
for
encoding
the
data
for
example
mathematicians
enjoy
simple
proofs
with
a
short
description
in
their
formal
language
sometimes
called
mathematical
beauty
another
example
draws
inspiration
from
th
century
proportion
studies
by
leonardo
da
vinci
and
albrecht
dürer
the
proportions
of
a
beautiful
human
face
can
be
described
by
very
few
bits
of
information
schmidhuber
explicitly
distinguishes
between
beauty
and
interestingness
he
assumes
that
any
observer
continually
tries
to
improve
the
predictability
and
compressibility
of
the
observations
by
discovering
regularities
such
as
repetitions
and
symmetries
and
fractal
self
similarity
when
the
observer
s
learning
process
which
may
be
a
predictive
neural
network
leads
to
improved
data
compression
the
number
of
bits
required
to
describe
the
data
decreases
the
temporary
interestingness
of
the
data
corresponds
to
the
number
of
saved
bits
and
thus
in
the
continuum
limit
to
the
first
derivative
of
subjectively
perceived
beauty
a
reinforcement
learning
algorithm
can
be
used
to
maximize
the
future
expected
data
compression
progress
it
will
motivate
the
learning
observer
to
execute
action
sequences
that
cause
additional
interesting
input
data
with
yet
unknown
but
learnable
predictability
or
regularity
the
principles
can
be
implemented
on
artificial
agents
which
then
exhibit
a
form
of
artificial
curiosity
while
low
complexity
art
does
not
require
a
priori
restrictions
of
the
description
size
the
basic
ideas
are
related
to
the
size
restricted
intro
categories
of
the
demoscene
where
very
short
computer
programs
are
used
to
generate
pleasing
graphical
and
musical
output
the
larger
context
provided
by
the
histories
of
both
art
and
science
suggests
that
low
complexity
art
will
continue
to
be
a
topic
of
growing
interest
in
respect
to
the
trajectory
of
science
and
technology
for
example
low
complexity
art
may
represent
another
case
in
which
the
relatively
new
discipline
of
computer
science
is
able
to
shed
fresh
light
on
a
disparate
subject
the
classic
example
being
those
insights
into
the
functioning
of
the
genetic
code
garnered
in
no
small
part
because
of
a
familiarity
with
issues
already
raised
in
the
practice
of
software
engineering
we
may
thus
expect
the
topic
of
low
complexity
art
to
help
foster
a
continued
and
fruitful
interaction
between
the
fields
of
computer
science
and
aesthetics
nor
will
the
insights
gained
be
purely
qualitative
indeed
the
formalizations
on
which
low
complexity
art
is
based
are
essentially
quantitative
in
respect
to
art
history
likewise
the
potential
relevance
of
low
complexity
art
extends
far
beyond
the
minimalistic
renaissance
encoding
of
beauty
already
cited
in
its
literature
the
idea
of
an
intimate
relationship
between
mathematical
structure
and
visual
appeal
is
one
of
the
recurring
themes
of
western
art
and
is
prominent
during
several
of
its
periods
of
fluorescence
including
that

of
the

a
secret
jihadist
with
murderous
plans
a
depraved
criminal
worthy

uncle
lubin
is
regarded
as
the
start
of
his
career
in
the
depiction
of
unlikely
machines
during
the
first

war
he
drew
large
numbers
of
cartoons
depicting
ever
more
unlikely
secret
weapons
being
used
by
the
combatants

depicted
the
american
expeditionary

produced
a
steady

of
humorous
drawings

his
favourites
as
absurdities

the
machines
he
drew
were
frequently
powered
by
steam
boilers

kettles
heated
by
candles

a
spirit
lamp

usually
kept
running
by
balding

robinson
s
cartoons
were
so
popular
that
in
britain
the
term
heath
robinson
is
used
to
refer
to
an
improbable
rickety
machine
barely
kept
going
by
incessant
tinkering
the
corresponding
term
in
the
u
s
is
rube
goldberg
after
an
american
cartoonist
with
an
equal
devotion
to
odd
machinery
similar
inventions
have
been
drawn
by
cartoonists
in
many
countries
with
the
danish
storm
petersen
being
on

with
robinson
and

one
of
his
most
famous
series
of

was
that
which

the
name
heath
robinson
became
part
of
common
parlance
in

for
complex

that
achieved
absurdly
simple
results
following
its
use
as
services
slang
during
the
first

war
during
the
falklands
war
british
harrier
aircraft
lacked
their
conventional
chaff
dispensing
mechanism
therefore
royal
navy
engineers
designed
an
impromptu
delivery
system
of
welding
rods
split
pins
and
string
which
allowed
six
packets
of
chaff
to
be
stored
in

deployed

state
transportation
officials
have
said
that
the
reason
for

stems
from
the
state
s
original
justification
for
building
parts
of

to
ease
traffic
congestion
on

by
providing
a
faster
alternate
route
even
for

traveling
short

overcome
potential
opposition
to
the
highway
from
towns

the

becoming
eclipsed
by
its
former
suburb
bagnoregio
at
the
end
of
the
th
century
the
bishop
and
the
municipal
government
were
forced
to
move
to

area
was
part
of
the
papal
states
in
the
th
century
civita
s
location
was
turning
into
an
island

the
pace
of
the
erosion
quickened

layer
of
clay
below
the
stone
was
reached
in

position
atop
a
plateau
of
friable
volcanic
tuff
overlooking
the
tiber
river
valley
it
is
in
constant
danger
of
destruction
as
the
edges
of
the
plateau
collapse
due
to
erosion
leaving
the
buildings
to
crumble
as
their
underlying
support
falls
away
as
of
update
there
were
plans
to
reinforce
the
plateau
with
steel
rods
to
prevent
further
geological
damage

city
is
also
much
admired
for
its
architecture

civita
di
bagnoregio
owes
much
of

unaltered
condition
to
its
relative
isolation

town
was
able
to
withstand
most
intrusions
of
modernity
as
well
as
the
destruction
brought
by
two

about
people
